Note:
natural and thin.key are from F2100 p47r28.  May need to be redone.

plant_alt.key and plant_bus.key are taken from F2100 p47r28 and modified, primarily by removing species (SS, GF, NF) which are not common in the Elliott and reassinging these portions to the other minor species (WH, RC, BM) that are.

In general, Elliott tree records are primarily DF with some WH, RA, RC and a surprising amount of CL which should be reflected in the natural.key file

PC, RF, TO, SS put in very minor appearances
