      <h1>About the Forest Scenario Planner</h1>
      <p>
        Ecotrust has created the Forest Scenario Planner to give forest managment scenario planning capacity to all Oregon and Washington land managers. Users will be able to <em>visualize alternative management scenarios</em> on your lands and receive immediate feedback on <em>how decisions might pay off</em> in terms of timber harvests and financial returns, as well as <em>public benefits</em> like carbon storage and ecosystem services.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h3>Using the Scenario Planning Tool Users May:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify their properties on an interactive map </li>
        <li>Use preloaded Forest Inventory Analysis data (FIA) or upload their own cruise data.</li>
        <li>Designate forest management areas or stands</li>
        <li>Define management prescriptions</li>
        <li>Specify timber and carbon market prices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scenario Planning Tool Outputs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphs of timber volume and financial returns generated over time</li>
        <li>Optimized harvest schedule</li>
        <li>Maps of standing timber volume, species and age class over time</li>
        <li>Visualize potential to realize carbon credits and ecostytem-based incentives over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Securely and confidentially store and manage data and scenario runs</li>
        <li>Share scenarios between collaborators to explore collaborative decision making among forest landowners and managers</li>
      </ul>
